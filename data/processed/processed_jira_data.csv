You can expect a response by 10 a.m. the next business day for requests sent outside of business hours. Thank you, Customer Relations Capital Area Food Bank [04/28/2024 12:52] The partner sent this via email without many details. A NetSuite search identified SO158855 as the record with an outstanding balance. I updated ticket fields with the details. The order was placed today (4/28/2024). There was a grant applied but it did leave a 172.27 balance. I do not know how to look up which grant was applied and if there are still funds available to cover this balance. Brad [04/29/2024 07:47] Good afternoon, I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that you can only apply one grant to a single line item. Currently, you have a remaining balance of $30.17 on your 1-H grant, which the system is trying to use to cover the cost of your 300015 Macaroni & Cheese. If you order a line item that costs more than $30.17, you will still have a balance. However, if you would like to use your other grant, which has a larger balance and can cover the entire line item cost of $202.44, we can arrange that for you so that you won't have any remaining balance to pay for this sales order. Please let me know which grant you would like to use, and I will put in a ticket with my IT team to make the necessary changes. Thank you, Daniele [04/29/2024 07:52] Please use I-I to cover the balance. Do I have to order something for 30.17 to use that grant?{adf}{""type"":""expand"",""content"":[{""type"":""paragraph"",""content"":[{""type"":""text"",""text"":""Doreen A.

You may order an item that is $50, and you will owe $20 afterward- in this case, the difference is larger so I will request that they use your larger grant. When this is complete I will let you know. [04/29/2024 09:51] The IT team has made this change. If you edit the order, it will revert back to the original coverage, so please let me know if you plan on editing it.

Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe Good morning, Partners, We hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to address the challenges posed by the inclement weather we have experienced over the past couple of days. Unfortunately, this has left us two days behind in our pulling schedule, which has led us to make the difficult decision to cancel the orders originally scheduled for Wednesday, January 8th. We sincerely regret any inconvenience this may cause to your distribution plans. We understand how vital these deliveries are to your operations. We encourage you to respond to this email and let us know whether you would like to finalize the cancellation of your order or reschedule it. Please note that we will need a response from your agency by the end of the business day ( 5 pm ) on January 7th , or the order will be canceled on our end. Please note that we are rescheduling orders, with the earliest openings being mid-week next week. This is due to our delivery and pickup schedules being full before the snow we experienced this week. Please reach out to us to coordinate further! We are fully aware of the impact that inclement weather can have on our collective efforts, and we remain committed to ensuring the safety of our staff and yours during this time. Thank you for your understanding and support as we navigate this situation together. We are working quickly to get back on schedule.

My initial thought is that the balance could be for an item that is not grant eligible, such as a donated item. Are all items on your order grant eligible? If you believe they are, screenshots would be helpful in determining what the issue might be. As a reminder, your cart will clear at midnight, so if you do want to reserve the items you will need to place by midnight tonight. Best, RC [04/28/2023 08:36] Hi Zelda, Just checking in!

One of a few things could be happening. 1.) If you are in editing mode, which means you clicked â€œEdit Orderâ€ and you are viewing your card- there will be error messages saying that there are zero availability because there is no more left of that item to add to your order. Whatever you had on your order before starting to edit the order is secured but the error message is saying that there is no more of this item available to add more of. 2.) If you did not hit save, which I see that you said you did- then you could have lost of the items. Previously, the old system held in the carts for 24 hours, but that is no longer the case. 3.) The last instance is that throughout the day, our warehouse team members are continuously doing quality checks. If for any reason produce fails that quality check or the warehouse team deems it as not being able to â€˜make itâ€™ (quality wise) to the date it's supposed to be delivered it can be taken off of your order. I am looking at your order and I do see eggplant, potatoes, cucumbers and squash on your orders. ""D"" [06/13/2023 02:11] Ok thanks so much for explaining.

Once you complete the checkout process, your items are put on a sales order and finalized. The emails you receive are due to potential errors in our inventory or the pulling process that may cause changes to your order before delivery. This can happen for two main reasons. Firstly, if the pulling team finds that the item's quality is not up to our standards for delivery, it may be removed from your order or the quantity decreased. This can occur when partners place orders well in advance and by the time the order is picked, the item may no longer meet our quality standards. Secondly, if we run out of a certain product, this could be due to periodic inventory errors where the actual count of items doesn't match what's on the menu. While we strive to minimize these occurrences, we send email notifications to keep partners informed in case such changes are necessary before their order is fulfilled. Thank you, ""D"" [08/19/2024 03:58] Hi, makes sense. I received some side eye looks from those I love so much. I tried to explain the selection was slim, and that I believed it to be secure.

to remove you as the reporter of this ticket, do you mind passing this along? Thank you!_ Good afternoon, Thank you for submitting this ticket to Customer Service. I have reviewed your reported issues and consulted with my colleagues in our Food Resources and Operations Teams. Regarding the tortillas, I apologize that they were sent out after their expiration date. I have reported this to the Food Resources Team for further investigation. However, since you received them, I have processed a credit of $45.60 for the tortillas you ordered (which had a discount applied). This credit will be applied to the invoice associated with your order, Invoice #180569. As for the flavored water, the date on the items indicated ""BB,"" which stands for ""best by."" Many of our donated foods may be past their best by or sell by dates. These dates are intended to inform you of when the item is not at its peak quality, not about food safety. The items are still safe to consume, and we encourage our partners to use their judgment. If there are any signs of concernâ€”such as changes in taste, smell, or packagingâ€”do not distribute the item and please let us know.

PART1-7899,Drivers are not able to see the special notes that are entered when order is placed,"MAIN CONTENT:
MAIN CONTENT: MAIN CONTENT: Hello, Of late, I am not getting a phone call letting me know that the driver is on their way to our Pantry. I enter a note for each of our orders asking that a driver call as they are leaving the warehouse so that our volunteers have enough time to get to our location when the truck arrives. We are a small organization - and our Pantry is just that - a large closet that stores a tremendous amount of food. We deliver our food to the clients so there is no 'office' available for volunteers to wait. When I scheduled today's delivery, a morning slot was not available. I had written asking if there would be any way to move our delivery up since we are normally an early delivery partner. I was told that the delivery schedule was full for the morning so that I had to keep my noon - 2 pm slot. I happened to be at the Pantry to do some stocking and the truck arrived at 10 AM! Luckily we were able to meet the driver with no delay to his schedule. I would appreciate it if drivers could please view the special notes/instructions for each delivery. I have been told by a few drivers that they do not see the special notes on their delivery receipt.

Thank you for your valuable feedback regarding our delivery process. I will connect with our Transportation Team to clarify the issue and explore ways to improve it. Each morning, our Transportation Leadership prints out the day's sales orders, which should include the notes you and your team leave. I will double-check to ensure this process is still in place, as we established a notes section specifically for partners to provide important information for our drivers. Additionally, I want to mention that there are times when drivers may finish their deliveries earlier than expected, or we may have more drivers available than anticipated. In such cases, drivers are instructed to call you to ask if you would like to receive your order before your scheduled delivery window. If you decline, they should wait until your designated delivery window. I will reach out to confirm these details and will follow up with you. I understand that the current situation is not ideal and the implications it has on your distribution. Best regards, ""D"" [11/21/2024 02:24] Good afternoon, Angela, I just spoke with Joe, the Transportation Manager. He informed me that he discussed the delivery process and the expectation for courtesy calls with the driver who made your delivery yesterday, as well as the team of drivers during their morning meeting today. Joe confirmed that drivers should be able to see the notes you leave on your sales orders. More importantly, it is mandatory for them to call all partners before their deliveries, even if they are within the designated delivery window. This call is to inform you that they are on their way. In instances where drivers can make earlier deliveries, they must consult with you first to see if you can accommodate the earlier arrival; if not, they are expected to wait until the agreed delivery window. If you continue to experience issues regarding this matter, please let me know, and I will arrange for Joe to give you a call to discuss it further. Best, ""D"""

Our Pantry is VERY small (but mighty). My volunteers that help unload the pallets do not arrive until I let them know the truck's ETA. So if a driver doesn't call, I may not be at the Pantry to receive it. Will is a great driver - so I did not say anything about not giving me a call on Wednesday - I happen to be at the Pantry so he was able to drop off my 2 pallets earlier than scheduled.

MAIN CONTENT: EMAIL HEADERS: From: Than Sent: Friday, November 15, 2024 1:14 PM Subject: BPSOS - Delivery Issue Hello Alanna, This is Than from BPSOS. I am writing this to let you know about an issue with our food delivery this morning 11/15. We ordered a total of 8 or 9 pallets of vegetables this morning. However, those pallets were stacked on top of each other as a pair when they were delivered. We asked the driver if he could bring the pallets down since they are very heavy (about 800 lbs each) and our office did not have any equipment to handle that. He said that there was nothing he could do because they were loaded into the truck like that. We did have this issue in the past and it took our staff (which comprised of many seniors) a tremendous amount of effort to handle it. We always appreciate CAFB for providing the food for free, but in the future, it would be great if you do not stack pallets on top of each other. If you have no choice but to do so, please let us know in advance.

I hope you are doing well. This is feedback that we have received across the regions and I have communicated it to the Operations Teams for their awareness. For now, please relay the message below to the partner: _Good afternoon- The Customer Relations Team has reported your concerns to our Senior Managers in Operations, and they are committed to helping our partners address these challenges. They will be reviewing options to improve the situation moving forward. For the time being, items will continue to be packed as they are currently, but the team is looking into alternatives that would make unpacking easier for you and other agencies. I will keep you updated on any developments. I want to assure you that your feedback has been heard and is being taken into consideration. The reason for the current packing method is due to truck capacity. If the pallets are not stacked, they will take up more space in the truck and could potentially require multiple trucks for delivery. Our drivers carry pallet jacks with them on their routes, but they do not have reach machines like those used in the warehouse to pull orders and unstack items. We are working on this, and I apologize for the challenges it presents. Please reach out to patnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.orgwith with any concerns you may have._ Best regards, ""D"" [11/19/2024 12:24] [_partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org_|mailto:patnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org]"

MAIN CONTENT: EMAIL HEADERS: From: Than Sent: Monday, November 25, 2024 10:06:59 AM Subject: BPSOS - Food Order Issue Hello Alanna, Happy Monday! This is Than from BPSOS. I am writing this because we encountered a technical issue on the website. Last Friday 11/22, we tried to add a few items, namely 2 of the 800908 Cabbage, Green Local 675# BIN 1/675 lbs Bin into our cart, to be delivered this Wednesday 11/27. However, it said that those items were not available on that selected date, but in the item description, it said that it will still be available until 12/10. As a result, we could not select those items back then. It was pretty late then, so I was not able to email you until today. I know that we may past the deadline for edit order; however, is it possible for you to remove all of the ""300597 Turkey Breast, 6-9# Basted w/ Gravy Packet 1/30.42486 lbs Case"" from our cart, and replace them with 2 of the ""800908 Cabbage, Green Local 675# BIN 1/675 lbs Bin?"" Additionally, do we still need to order more than 1000 lbs to be eligible for delivery? I know that we are asking a lot Alanna, but we want to make sure that our vulnerable and underserved population can enjoy a good Thanksgiving this week. We would appreciate a lot if you can help us.

[11/25/2024 02:37] Good afternoon, Grace, I hope you are doing well. I wanted to bring this matter to Austin and discuss it with her. I understand the implications of the large orders and the concerns surrounding the removal of produce for the produce hub. When I spoke to Austin, she suggested that the first step should be to have a conversation with the partner to explain the implications of their edits to the order. They need to be mindful that they donâ€™t want to lose their produce items meant for the hub and that they should be aware of the weight of their orders when placing them. Here are two key points I discussed with Austin: 1. Currently, we do not have a formal limit for orders, so we cannot tell them what a limit would be. Operations and ERP/IT are working on measures to ensure that for large orders, the number of delivery blocks corresponds appropriately. For example, two weeks ago, Capital Christianâ€™s order required five trucks for delivery but only occupied one slot, which is unrealistic. For now, we can only ensure that Operations is aware and prepared for these situations. 2. Austin mentioned that if this situation continues to cause recurring issues and impacts the produce hub's participating sitesâ€”resulting in a loss of produceâ€”we can consider locking their orders for the produce hubs and requesting that they create a separate order. However, this could complicate matters since Operations has asked us to consolidate orders for the same partner to avoid having one sales order versus two. We can explore this locking option as a last resort if recurring issues continue. I hope this clarifies the situation, and please let me know if you need any assistance in engaging with the partner. Best, ""D"""

I have a request about the Produce Hub: is it possible that the pallets of produce are not stacked on top of each other? SEED comes with a truck like the one from CAFB so it uses the pallet jack to pick up their produce but when the pallets are stacked on top of each other, we have no way to lower the pallet of produce which is on top which we forced to cut the cardboard, to extract the product into a bin so that another partner can have its product. If the pallets come individually, each organization has the possibility of collecting its pallet of produce to its truck. Also I looked at the order for the Hub but I only saw 50 squash boxes instead of 176 (the 58 boxes are the ones I ordered for my distribution). Will the rest be added later?

I have spoken to our Operations Manager in the DC warehouse, and unfortunately, we are unable to unstack or repack the pallets of produce in a different manner due to the truck's space capacity and efficiency reasons. Packing the pallets differently would require sending multiple trucks, causing inefficiency, and we also do not have the bandwidth to unstack and unpackage the cases and pallets of produce for each partner participating in the produce hub. One suggestion is that your agency acquire a pallet jack during the next round of capacity grants to assist with this issue. I will also pass this feedback on to the Operations Leadership team for consideration, but currently, our Operations Team cannot accommodate it under our current operating procedures. I apologize for this. Thanks, ""D"" [08/22/2024 09:23] Thank you so much for your explanation\! Be blessed! [08/22/2024 09:23] Customer has replied after the ticket has been resolved."

Regards, Godwin [08/28/2024 09:56] Good morning Godwin, I hope this message finds you well. I am writing in response to your recent produce requests, particularly your most recent message. I want to assure you that we do receive all of your produce requests. As we've mentioned before, we can only add produce that is available. Charity, the Customer Service Coordinator who has been assisting you, explained that we did not have any produce available on Monday. She assured you that she would monitor our inventory and add the produce to your order before it locks *if* it becomes available. Charity kept your ticket open and checked the menu regularly, but unfortunately, we did not have any produce to add to your order before it locked yesterday evening. I understand your frustration with this process, but please know that the produce we receive is put on the menu as soon as it is available. While my team supports partners by monitoring the menu, it would be best for you to also check the menu for updates. Unfortunately, we cannot add produce that is simply not available. I hope this provides some clarity. I also double-checked for any available produce before sending this message and saw that none was available.

Even though your order is locked, I will continue to look out for produce today for your agency, as I understand the issues you've had with securing produce for your last two orders. I think it would be helpful for you to meet with Laura and me to discuss this issue further, as it seems to be a recurring problem that is affecting your orders. Can you please let us know some days and times you are available to meet with both Laura and me this week or next week over Zoom? Thank you for your patience.

MAIN CONTENT: MAIN CONTENT: We are by this mail request Capital Area Foodbank to include in our order for this month 100pcs of Turkey for Thanksgiving, whenever it is available. Our intention is to have our food give out on Saturday 23rd November 2024 by 12noon We thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Regards, Godwin Binutu For: CCC Covenant Parish. 2404678399",Request of Customer Relations,Orders - Pre delivery -> Produce Request,Email Request,Email to Jira,Closed,Medium,2024-11-06 10:42:00,2024-11-12 08:59:00,02:54:00,,"[11/06/2024 02:35] Good afternoon Godwin, This year, our Food Procurement Team purchased two truckloads of turkeys, each at a cost of approximately $60 to $70 per case and were available on PartnerLink. These turkeys have been allocated to various orders and are no longer available. I reached out to my colleagues on the Food Resources Team, who informed me that we often receive donated turkeys. These donations will be provided at no cost now that the shared maintenance fee has been waived for donated items. _However_, *we cannot predict if and when these donations will arrive*. Typically, individuals and organizations tend to donate turkeys closer to Thanksgiving, usually in the week before the holiday or during the holiday week itself. Please continue to check the menu regularly to see if turkeys are added. If we do receive them, they will be added to the menu and available to partners on a first-come, first-served basis. Thank you, DH [11/07/2024 01:15] Dear Harmon. Thank you for your response. We buy Turkey every year from CAFB in bulk you can check your record. I think our organization should have been given some consideration during the sharing of 2 trucks load of Turkey. We don't rely on donations we buy our Turkey every year. We observed that since Elvis left we have been having issues inrespect of our order, this is very unfair. Our community are expecting thanksgiving Turkey from us only to disappoint them at the end. Regards, Godwin Binutu [11/07/2024 01:00] Good afternoon Godwin, I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to me again regarding the turkey availability. I completely understand how important this is for your community, especially during the holidays. I want to clarify that all the turkeys we receive are available on a first come, first served basis for all our partners, just like other items on the menu. I also realize that in previous years, there was a fee associated with our donated turkeys (0.19 cents per pound). However, Iâ€™m pleased to share that this fee has been waived for this fiscal year, so itâ€™s possible you may have paid in the past but you would not have to this time for the donated product. I genuinely want to ensure that you and your clients receive the support you need this holiday season. I understand how quickly these items can disappear from the menu, and I encourage you to check it daily, as we frequently add new products. Right now, we also have vegetable oil, stuffing mix, corn muffin mix, canned collard greens, and beans that might help supplement your holiday distributions. Please feel free to check the menu regularly, and if I see any additional turkeys come available, I will reach out to you. Thank you for your understanding, and know that we are here to support you and your community during this important time.

I would be happy to connect with you to discuss any challenges you are having. Regarding the turkeys, unfortunately, we donâ€™t have the capacity to track every partner that has received turkeys in the past, and it wouldnâ€™t be fair to our other partners to reserve inventory for a select few. However, there are times when we will receive a donation that is specifically allocated for the DC region. While this isnâ€™t a guarantee that we will receive such a donation, nor a promise to reserve anything, the regional team has made note of your interest and will notify you if we receive a special donation of turkeys for the region. As ""D"" mentioned, I also encourage you to continue checking PartnerLink so you will be aware as new items are added. Please let me know if you have any further questions for the DC regional team. Thank you for your continued partnership and the work you are doing to serve our community.

We provide partners with 24 hours for perishable items and 72 hours for non-perishable items to notify us about returns, exchanges, or any issues with their orders. We also encourage all partners to thoroughly review their orders upon delivery or pickup, so they can inform us about any discrepancies as soon as possible. I understand that circumstances, such as delivery day events, holidays, and our holiday and snow closures, can sometimes disrupt this process which can acount in the delay in notification.

It's on our team for not checking properly the case size and weight but the chicken which we received was the following: 300595 Chicken Leg Quarters, Halal 5# Chicken Leg Quarters, Halal 5# 6/5 lbs Bag We received 9 cases of the above chicken. I knew it wasn't correct based on the count and the fact that it was halal. I believe this is a purchase item through the CAFB website and wanted to check with you and the team to see how you would like to proceed. As a side note, on a past order we received 6 cases of TEFAP red kidney beans instead we had ordered 6 cases of TEFAP pears which was a minor problem and explained the importance of checking the order with our team prior to accepting.

PART1-8640,Fw: Damaged food,"MAIN CONTENT:
MAIN CONTENT: EMAIL HEADERS: From: Emily Sent: Sunday, February 23, 2025 8:41 AM Subject: Damaged food Alanna We received a delivery of food on Tuesday, February 18. Everything was fine except for one case of peaches. 17 cans out of 24 in the case were damaged. I have pictures below. The cans with the black spots are holes where the juice leaked out. The two cans on paper had leaked and were stuck to the paper. You can see all the cans that were wet. We cannot give out food that is stained like this; plus, we have no way of knowing if the contents are bad. We could use only 7 cans from this box. Since prices are so much higher now and our money is tighter, we would like a refund. I have not heard anything about the cans of pears that were damaged a few weeks ago. Have a good week.

I tried to checkout a couple of times and got the same message. I tried logging out and logging back in. When I logged back in the cart symbol at the top right was in the process of being emptied it was counting down. Which I thought was a good thing because when you actually get to place the order it does that usually. But once it was done counting down there wasn't a new sales order. I didn't check yet but I assume the time slot I had is no longer available for delivery? Do I just have to start all over and pick a different delivery day and time? Will I still need to do it in two orders and provide you with the two sales order numbers so you can change it to the same day and time? We usually use the invoice option when checking out but it wasn't available so we used the debit card. Once someone from your end took a bunch of items out the invoice option was available. So if this is something you can do from your end you wouldn't need the CC info you could just choose the invoice option for each order and set it up for this Thursday. Please advise.

I spoke to our IT Department this morning and wanted to relay some of the information that we discussed. First, the reason that you are unable to invoice your orders is because your agency has a balance over 90 days which means that your invoicing capabilities have been removed. Your agencyâ€™s balance is $2,254.84. Until this amount is paid off, we will not be able to invoice any of your orders. Secondly, because we are unable to invoice your orders. We internally cannot place an order for you because we don't have access to your card information. I confirmed with our IT Team that the max number of items that PartnerLink will allow you to check out with is 21. The quantities do not play a factor into this, just the number of items themselves. If you are able to, please check out and place two orders to ensure you get all your items by place two orders that have 21 items. For reference, this is an issue that our IT Team is currently working on fixing so that we do not have to do this continuously. Please let me know if you have any questions. Again, I do apologize for the inconvenience. If you have questions about this, please feel free to give me a call at 571-390-9875 ""D"" [10/03/2023 11:31] Am I correct in assuming at this point we can't do this Thursday for a delivery date?{adf}{""type"":""expand"",""content"":[{""type"":""paragraph"",""content"":[{""type"":""text"",""text"":""Jeff Haynie Bedrock Foundations, Inc. 301-627-1313 Ofc. 301-627-3691 Fax 301-440-3051 Cell""}]}],""attrs"":{""title"":""Signature""}}{adf} [10/03/2023 11:54] This Thursday or Thursday the 12th?

We are reaching out to address the challenges posed by the inclement weather we have experienced over the past couple of days. Unfortunately, this has left us two days behind in our pulling schedule, which has led us to make the difficult decision to cancel the orders originally scheduled for Wednesday, January 8th. We sincerely regret any inconvenience this may cause to your distribution plans. We understand how vital these deliveries are to your operations. We encourage you to respond to this email and let us know whether you would like to finalize the cancellation of your order or reschedule it. Please note that we will need a response from your agency by the end of the business day ( 5 pm ) on January 7th , or the order will be canceled on our end. Please note that we are rescheduling orders, with the earliest openings being mid-week next week. This is due to our delivery and pickup schedules being full before the snow we experienced this week. Please reach out to us to coordinate further! We are fully aware of the impact that inclement weather can have on our collective efforts, and we remain committed to ensuring the safety of our staff and yours during this time.

Additionally, after making any edits, partners must wait another 30 minutes before they can make further changes. Keep this in mind when making edits._ Please let me know if you can edit your order now, and also please send me any edits you need done.

We want to ensure that all the food leaving our warehouse is safe for consumption and properly dated for your knowledge. Some of the items you mentioned are *donated products*. As we increase the donated products on our menu, I want to make sure that all partners are aware that Capital Area Food Bank accepts donations with items past their best by and sell by dates. The best by date is an indicator of the quality of a product but is not a safety date. The sell by date is for inventory management and tells the store for how long to display the product for sale. The product can still be consumed after this date. It's important to note that many of our donated products will be past these dates, but they are not expired and are still safe for consumption. We have food coding guides that partners can print and reference during distributions. When available, they can be ordered in English and Spanish from our Nutrition Education Department. The dates on some products may cause concerns for partners and their clients, but we urge you all to differentiate between the different dates on products, use the food coding guide as a reference, and also use your best judgment as well as your food safety knowledge. If you have a product that is not of the right consistency, has an odor, or you believe to be not okay, please let us know and discard the item immediately. As we increase our donations, we may encounter some challenges, but please work with us and continue to provide us with feedback. Additionally, if you ever have an issue with fresh produce, please include photos of the items so that we can forward them to our Operations and Food Resourcing Departments for their knowledge. We appreciate your partnership with us in this.

I'd be happy to assist you with your query. Our system applies grants on a per-line-item basis, meaning only one grant can be applied to each line item. In your past couple of orders, you have had line items with high numbers ranging from $250 to $2,653.30. Â The system is going to use the grant that has enough available funds which might not be the one with the closest expiration date. Please see below: You have three grants: * 1-G $3,000 (Expires 1^st^) ** SO136067 used $890.00 ** SO122558 used $812.60 *** Remaining Balance: $514.98 * 1-H $2,378 (Expires 2^nd^) ** SO146902 used $762.58 ** SO142621 used $1,498.84 *** Remaining Balance: $116.58 * 1-I $6,564 (Expires 3^rd^) ** *SO157471 (your most recent order)* _was placed and totaled in $854.20, the only grant that could cover the entirety of this line item for the chicken was your 1-I grant. If the system pulled from either of your other two grants, it would not cover the total cost of the chicken._ I hope this clarifies the situation.

PART1-7845,Re: Issue with Food Assistance Delivery from Gaithersburg HELP,"MAIN CONTENT:
MAIN CONTENT: MAIN CONTENT: Ms. Jackson, Gaithersburg HELP is an all-volunteer organization that has been serving the needy in our local community for 56 years, and we are dedicated to supporting as many families with food each month as we can. In fact, last month HELP served 500 families at our pantry in the Festival Shopping Center. We have only a couple of volunteer drivers who can deliver food, and we must reserve that service for those individuals who live alone or have a partner who also can't drive to the pantry. You had asked for us to deliver food to a family of 9 people. As you must know from your previous food pickups, which total 30 since 2018, we pack according to family size; so a family of 9 would receive at least 8 heavy bags of groceries. We simply can't ask a volunteer, all of whom tend to be over 60 years of age, to pick up and deliver many bags of groceries; and that would not be appropriate when there are able-bodied family members in residence. As an all-volunteer organization, we strive to serve as many families as possible; but we can sustain our operation only if almost all of our families pick up at the pantry. If a client needs to come to the pantry via bus, we offer bus tokens so that transportation to and from the pantry is free. It is not an insult to let someone know that we have limited capabilities for food delivery. It's just a fact. And we would not ask to see proof of disability. We explain our limited delivery ability to any client who asks about delivery. Also, our coordinators always provide information about how to get food from Manna and/or the Gaithersburg Hope Center. Clients can get food from us while also getting food from those other organizations. In that way, we hope clients find they have more money to apply toward rent or utility bills. Our yearly client survey results validate that outcome and that our volunteers treat clients with dignity and promptness. We could serve your family very quickly with food if someone could drive to the pantry or come via bus. Margo On Thu, Nov 14, 2024 at 2:11'¯PM 'Yvette Jackson' via Info wrote: Dear Capital Area Food Bank Support Team, My name is Yvette Jackson, and I am writing to report an issue I experienced with food assistance delivery from Gaithersburg HELP. On Monday at 9:36 a.m., I called to apply for food assistance delivery, but my request was refused based on the number of people in my household and our ages. Specifically, this refusal has caused significant inconveniences and insult to my family and me, as we urgently need food assistance. Insulting my family by indicating ""With such a large family someone should be able to take the bus here for pick up!"" shows a lack of empathy and compassion. After making a complaint, I received a response at 12:54 p.m. today, indicating that the refusal and statement were correct due to the volunteer nature of the service and their inability to deliver help to a large household. I was directed to seek assistance from other sources such as Manna Food. I believe there might be a misunderstanding or miscommunication regarding our eligibility for this service. Attached to this email, you will find documentation of my disability for your review. Please note the MetroAccess document on line 16, which indicates that my disability prevents me from independently using the accessible Metrobus and Metrorail system for all trips. I am unable to walk due to L spine disease with a risk of falls, panic attacks, anxiety, and non-tolerance to crowds. At this point, I feel my disability, age, and household circumstances are severely limiting my access to essential help. I would appreciate your assistance in reviewing this matter and providing any necessary support to ensure that my household can receive the food assistance we need as it appears Gaithersburg Help is not completely meeting the needs of the community.

""Able-bodied"" typically refers to a person who has no physical disabilities and can perform tasks without any limitations caused by a disability. Many people with disabilities or health conditions can still work, often with the help of accommodations or support. So, just because someone has a job, it doesn't necessarily mean they don't have a disability.

Are the dates sent on the email the best until dates: 100856 - Hot fries, 100854 - Glutino bars, 100858 - Caramel Popcorn?

[06/17/2024 08:48] Hi drey_v27@yahoo.com, We just received your request for assistance. We will reply as soon as possible. Thank you, Customer Relations Capital Area Food Bank [06/17/2024 12:07] Good afternoon, Thank you for contacting customer support. I am looking into the dates for your previous orders to confirm that they are safe to eat. As a reference, feel free to use our Food Coding Guide (attached) as a resource when navigating different dates. I will follow up with you as soon as I get updates regarding the products you asked about. [^Date Coding Guide.pdf] Charity [06/26/2024 04:51] Hi Andrea, I hope you are doing well. I wanted to talk to you about the ticket you submitted. I apologize for the delay. One of my team members brought up your concerns regarding some items you received from us. After discussing your concerns about the salad dressing with my management and the Food Sourcing Team responsible for all the food that comes into the Food Bank, here are some points I wanted to share with you. Regarding the salad dressing, our Food Resourcing Team does not have a specific recommendation for shelf-stable milk or salad dressing in our Food Coding Guide. We suggest following the USDA's recommendation regarding this product specifically and apologize for not being able to provide further insight. Partners and clients should use their eyes, noses, and, taste buds to determine if a food is spoiled and therefore unsafe to eat. Of course, if a product is showing any signs of spoilage such as rot, mold, foul odor, etc., we will accept a return. I have brought this issue to management's attention, and I agree that our Food Coding Guide needs improvement. I will raise this with our leadership for further review. In response to your second point, I acknowledge the importance of best-by dates for our partners and their clients. However, our team faces challenges in obtaining these dates for donated products. One challenge arises during packing events when volunteers check and pack donated items into cases labeled as assorted on the menu. These assorted cases contain items from various donors and are packed without specific best-by date information for each individual product. Another challenge occurs when we receive donated products in different case lots-with different dates, making it difficult to provide accurate best-by dates to our partners. We don't know what case lot your order is going to be pulled from until its pulled the day before or two before its delivered or picked up. Although we practice FIFO (first in, first out) inventory management, the dynamic nature of our inventory makes it challenging to predict best-by dates with certainty. As our inventory of donated products increases, we are committed to improving our processes to provide partners with the information they need to make informed decisions. We are continuously seeking ways to improve our processes, and I encourage partners to participate in the upcoming Partner meetings in July to address any questions or recommendations regarding product dates. Thank you for bringing these concerns to our attention. Warm regards, ""D"""

This is from SO180219. The the mustard greens was already breaking down and gave off a terrible smell. Both the yellow summer squash and strawberry only 50% usable. The yellow squash looked like it was frozen and then defrosted with some molds. The strawberries were moldy. Both items did not look like they had significant issues from initial inspection. It is only when you start taking them out really looking carefully that you would notice the quality issues.

It is a pallet of meals to go that we were going to offer our clients as back to school choice. We were planning giving at least 2-3 per family. Right now we are going to end up giving 1 per family. It is disappointing. I dropped the other individual cases and decided on a pallet thinking that surely CAFB knows how many full pallets they have of an item since it is large and there are only 15 posted (at least when I initially saw it). It is even more disappointing because every week it seems as though an item is being removed from our order. This week it is a full pallet of meals to go. Last week it was 6 cases of eggs, and 3 weeks ago a bin or corn. I thought that when the number of items get posted to Partner Link, these are the number of items available to order. I am trying to understand why the items are missing by the time items get pulled. And it should not be happening almost every week. I have the same pallet ordered for delivery date 8/23.

The pastor said he went ahead and received the order because of what the driver told him but was concerned that our full order may not be there because he is unfamiliar with the receiving process. Our delivery window is 10 am-12 pm. I spoke with the driver around 9:30 and I told I will be there a little before 10 but he was gone by the time I arrived. Also, is it possible have the best by dates for the items below, additional info, and for pictures for some of them: 100826 Best by date, how many in one case/box 100818 Best by date, how many in a case/box 100837 Best by date 100833 Best by date and picture Thank you.

PART1-8152,Unavailability of Fruit & Vegetables in Cases,"MAIN CONTENT:
MAIN CONTENT: MAIN CONTENT: Hi Partner Support, We were told that cases of fresh vegetables would be available some time ago. They are never available when we're placing our orders. So, does that mean they are really never going to be available anymore for small sites with no dock availabilty? We have not been able to pick up fresh vegetables since Covid began and in-house shopping was discontinued. Your positive response would be appreciated. MaryAnn Tolbert",Request of Customer Relations,Orders - Pre delivery -> Produce Request,Email Request,Email to Jira,Closed,Medium,2025-01-04 01:01:00,2025-01-07 05:39:00,-5:00,00:00:00,"[01/06/2025 08:14] Good afternoon, Thank you for reaching out to Customer Relations. I appreciate your inquiry. We offer a variety of fruits and vegetables on our menu throughout the week, but the selection can vary depending on seasonal availability. During the winter months, for example, we typically have fewer options compared to the summer when a wider variety of produce is available. In recent weeks, the fruits and vegetables available have primarily included potatoes, apples, and carrots. Due to producelimitations placed on agencies, our Food Resources Team is working to bring in more produce items in case lot instead of large bins and full pallets, but this remains an ongoing challenge. Currently, all produce items must be ordered through PartnerLink, as there are no plans to reopen the agency mart for direct pickups. I have two suggestions to enhance your experience in this situation. First, you can place orders up to 10 days in advance of your scheduled pickup and delivery date. I recommend placing your order as soon as the calendar opens and frequently checking PartnerLink for available produce. You can edit and add to your order until it locks for fulfillment, which is three business days prior to the shipment date. This flexibility allows you to include any additional items you may find during that 10-day window.

There is a new feature available on PartnerLink that allows partners to update their hours of operations for their distributions. This feature will enable you to keep your records up to date as required, which is important for ensuring that we have the most current information in our internal systems for our clients to use. Once approved, the information collected from your updates will be linked to our online tool that clients can use to find food assistance: Get Help Map|https: www.capitalareafoodbank.org/find-food-assistance/ . To ensure that all partners understand how to use this function, we have hosted three trainings, and there is one session remaining on September 19th from 9 am to 10 am . These sessions have been designed to demonstrate how to use this feature and provide an opportunity to speak to our team about PartnerLink and offer feedback.

One of their initiatives is to start procuring cases for our smaller agencies that have produce limits under 2,000 lbs. I also want to remind you that if you see a pallet of, for example, 2,000 lbs, the system will allow you to order over your limit. Customer Service will then reach out to you to discuss your options.

Could you please forward the response below on my behalf? Thank you! ---- Good afternoon, Thank you for reaching out to Customer Service. You had a great question about our recall process. For our DDP programs (mobile and community markets), the recall outreach process differs from that of the partnership teams. When a recall is identified, our Food Resources, Analytics, and Operations Teams collaborate with our programs and my team (Customer Relations) to contact the partners who ordered the affected items. It is then the partners' responsibility to reach out to their clients. For DDP, the process is slightly different. I recommend contacting Jessica Arias, one of our managers on the DDP team, to learn more about how they notify their sites and assist those sites in informing their respective clients.

Regarding the Produce Boxes, we have contacted your Regional Coordinators, Grace and Augusta, and they will communicate with Coastalâ€™s Customer Service Team to address the problem with your produce boxes that were not distributable. Augusta has offered to follow up with them and relay any next steps back to you. As for the peanut butter, thank you for providing photos. We appreciate it. The peanut butter in your order, as well as many of our other donated items, have passed their ""best by"" date. This date indicates when the product will be at its best flavor or quality and is not a safety date. Itâ€™s a quality date that encourages consumers to eat food while it is in its prime state. Food that is past this date is not bad and should not be thrown away. We provide a food coding guide to our partners that explains these dates further. We want to reassure you that the peanut butter is not expired and will not cause any harm to consumers. We offer the Food Coding Guides as a resource and we have them printed and available to order for partners as well to pass out at distributions. [^Food Coding Guidance.pdf] Thank you, ""D"""

I'd be happy to assist you with your query. Our system applies grants on a per-line-item basis, which means that only one grant can be applied to each line item. In the case of your order, the line item is $817.00, and the system initially used the last of your FY24 MD Region Moco 1-G grant, which was $75.59. However, as per your request, I have contacted our IT department to apply your FY24 MD Region MOCO 1-I grant to that line item since it is the only grant you have that can cover the entire amount. Please note that moving forward, the $75.59 remaining on your 1-G grant and the $18.01 left on your 1-H grant may not cover the entire line item cost. If this happens, it is because our system applies the grants on a per-line-item basis. If you have a line item that costs less than these amounts in future orders, then you will have no remaining balance. I hope this clarifies the situation.

However, if you would like to use your other grant, Grant 1-I or Grant 1-H, which have a larger balances and can cover the entire line item cost we can arrange that for you so that you won't have any remaining balance to pay for this sales order. Please let me know which grant you would like to use, and I will put in a ticket with my IT team to make the necessary changes. Thank you, ""D"" [04/29/2024 01:54] Yes you can use anyone of our grant funds to cover [04/29/2024 02:04] Okay, I will have our IT team go ahead and make this change.

We will reply as soon as possible. Thank you, Customer Relations Capital Area Food Bank [07/03/2024 11:10] Good morning, Thank you for your questions about the limited items on the menu. While I don't have a general answer, there are several factors at play. Firstly, at certain times of the year, we have constraints on our receiving calendar, which leads to fewer inventory trucks due to scheduling conflicts. Currently, we are facing this situation as we were closed for Juneteenth, went through our bi-annual inventory last week, and will also be closed for the July 4th observance next week. Additionally, as we prepare for our move back to home building in the Virginia region, there may be a slight shift in the amount of products as we transition inventory from one location to another. This means we have been and will continue to receive fewer trucks than usual and are trying to schedule loads that fit within this restricted schedule. Moreover, while donations vary, we are actively working to increase the amount of donated food we receive and make it available through our Partner Direct Program and the menu. This issue will be discussed in an upcoming in-person partner meeting in July, giving partners the opportunity to hear from our leadership and our Food Resourcing Team, who are responsible for sourcing all the food on the menu, both donated and purchased. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. Thanks, ""D"""

Jon [10/10/2024 03:36] I have updated your account and clicked on the verify button. The hours listed are not the general hours of operation for your office or establishment, but instead indicate the days and hours when you distribute food. Your agency is listed as distributing food on Thursdays from 3pm to 5pm. You will be asked to confirm this information approximately once every quarter (or every 3 months). We will require you to log in and confirm that you are distributing food at the same time. To do so, please log into your account, go to the ""hours of operation"" tab, and click on 'verify' if the information is correct and unchanged. You can then proceed with your shopping. If you need to change your distribution hours, you should use the 'edit' button. This information is shared with the broader community, so it's important that our distribution hours are accurate. Thank you! Your account is now available for shopping. [10/10/2024 03:43] FYI, we are not a distribution location. [10/10/2024 03:43] Customer has replied after the ticket has been resolved.

[09/10/2024 10:17] There are no regulations limiting how much a partner can order, but I really do not think these quantities are reasonable. They have ordered 1,121 CASES of fruit (300 nectarines, 513 plums, 308 peaches), but they distribute to 280-350 households. This means that each household would receive at least 3 CASES of fruit. Thatâ€™s in addition to the CAFB produce that theyâ€™ve also ordered. This is really excessive.

[02/21/2025 09:48] Good morning Jeanette, I hope youâ€™re doing well today. I was very concerned to hear about the issues youâ€™ve encountered with mice droppings and the presence of mice near the food you received from us. Please know that I am genuinely sorry for this distressing experience, and I want to extend my heartfelt apologies on behalf of Capital Area Food Bank and our Customer Service and Operations Team. This morning, I forwarded the information you provided in your ticket, along with your photos, to our Director of Operations. She is taking this matter very seriously and has scheduled a meeting with her team to ensure we find a prompt and effective resolution. They will be focusing on maintaining cleanliness and ensuring rodent protection in our facilities, as well as inspecting our warehouse products, particularly those in question, to ensure they are removed if necessary. I want to support you through this situation. Could you please let me know which specific products you needed to be disposed of due to the potential rodent issue, aside from the bins of cereal? I understand how disruptive this can be to your food distribution efforts, and I truly empathize with the challenges it presents in providing safe and healthy food to the community you serve. I will also reach out to my supervisor to discuss possible compensation for the inconvenience caused by this situation, as we value your partnership and want to make things right. Thank you for your understanding, and once again, Iâ€™m truly sorry for the trouble this has caused. We are committed to resolving this matter as quickly as possible. Best wishes, ""D"" [02/25/2025 08:11] {color:#172B4D}Dear ""D"",{color} {color:#172B4D} Thank you so much for your prompt response and for addressing this matter with great regard.

I wanted to reach out personally to follow up on the recent incident and to express my sincere apologies for any disruption it may have caused you. I have escalated this matter to our Operations Director, and I want you to know that we have a new leader in Operations who is dedicated to ensuring we serve our partners with the utmost care and precision. She is committed to making improvements and has assured me that we are taking significant steps to prevent such situations from occurring in the future. Some of the measures weâ€™re implementing include: 1. Continuing our routine pest control efforts. 2. Collaborating with our pest control company, which visited our facility on Monday to conduct additional work beyond our normal maintenance. 3. Strengthening our inspection processes to ensure that all pullers, drivers, and inspectors thoroughly check every order once it's staged. 4. Focusing on the quality of products going out to our partners. 5. Preparing for the warmer months ahead to maintain a rodent-free and clean environment for the food we deliver. I truly empathize with the impact this situation may have had on your operations, and I want to assure you that we are committed to providing a better service moving forward. Please know that we value your partnership and appreciate your understanding during this time. As a gesture of goodwill, we would like to waive the delivery fees for both your recent order and your upcoming order on March 3rd. If you have any questions or concerns, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. Your feedback is important to us, and weâ€™re here to help. Thank you for your understanding.

The expiration date, or use-by date, on food helps to estimate the expected timeframe that the food will still be at its highest quality. [04/26/2024 07:37] Ticket migrated to a new Jira Project.

This feature is crucial for maintaining accurate information about your agency's operating hours, which in turn updates our [Get Help Map|https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/find-food-assistance/] on the website. The Get Help Map is a tool that clients use to locate nearby CAFB Partners, so it's essential to have the correct hours displayed. If you were unable to attend the trainings, don't worry. There are alternative options available, such as accessing the resource on PartnerLink under the Partner Resources tab, or signing up for [Customer Relations Office Hours|https://capitalareafoodbank.zoom.us/zbook/partner-support/customer-relations-office-hours] held every Wednesday from 10am-11am. Please note that due to the nature of the training, there are no recordings or slides available, as it involved a live demo and Q&A session. While partners are not being reprimanded for not attending a training, it's important to highlight that starting *October 1st*, partners who have not updated or confirmed their hours will see a banner prompting them to do so before placing an order. You will need to take this action to proceed with making an order. If your hours have not changed, simply verify them by accessing the Agency Overview section after clicking your agency name on PartnerLink. If changes are necessary, please update them accordingly. For further assistance, please contact us at [partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org|mailto:partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org]. [09/25/2024 08:16] So I went and clicked verify. Are we good now? Thanks, Jeff [09/26/2024 08:44] Yes, you are good. In the future, when you receive requests for updates, your account is not locked; it is simply asking for you to verify your information before you can proceed with placing an order.

For example, if we announce a 2-hour delay, all delivery and pickup windows will be pushed back accordingly. This means that if you had an 8 AM - 10 AM delivery, it will now be scheduled for 10 AM - 12 PM. If we face a complete closure due to the weather, there will be no deliveries or pickups. On such days, the Customer Relations team will be available to reschedule deliveries and reach out to all partners regarding their orders. Additionally, please keep in mind that depending on the amount of snow, there may be impacts on the days following the snowfall.

Will the pallet that I recently ordered be delivered on the requested date, January 23rd. Does the weight prevent me from ordering in the future? Please advise. Paula Porter Metropolitan Baptist Church [01/17/2025 11:30] Customer has replied after the ticket has been resolved. [01/17/2025 12:15] Good morning, I am happy to provide further insight. The pallet you ordered will not be removed from your order and will be delivered on the 21st. However, this pallet has exceeded your agencyâ€™s produce limit of *250lbs*. At this time, due to the transition of implementing produce limits, we are not removing any produce from orders even if it exceeds their limit to allow partners to adjust. Once partners are more familiar of this process, we will begin adjusting orders, in communication with you, to have your orders align closer to your monthly allotted poundage. You are able to continue submitting orders as your agency allows, but for the rest of this or any month, you will no longer be eligible to order more produce once the limit has been met or exceeded. Please reach out to your Regional Team should you feel like an adjustment would be most beneficial for your agency. Hope this helps! Charity [01/21/2025 07:01] Good Morning Charity, I wanted to confirm our conversation last week, that my order, S0191939 which includes a produce pallet, will be changed from pickup to *delivery*. I received my CAFB confirmation email yesterday and it reflects pickup. Please advise if I need to take any further steps to ensure delivery. Thank you so much for all your support.

Unfortunately, after researching our internal resources, I was unable to find guidance on snack-type items. We primarily use the Food Coding Guide to help partners navigate such questions. When there are gaps, we recommend relying on research and information available online, particularly the USDA website. Furthermore, we advise partners and clients to use their senses (sight, smell, and taste) to determine if a food is spoiled and unsafe to eat.[Food Product Dating | Food Safety and Inspection Service (usda.gov)|https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/food-product-dating] [Shelf-Stable Food Safety | Food Safety and Inspection Service (usda.gov)|https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/shelf-stable-food] I have also noted that for our development, I will raise this issue to our leadership. I believe that having a more comprehensive tool would be incredibly useful for many partners. ""D"" [07/03/2024 01:08] Hi ""D"", I really appreciate your thoughtful response on this.

Thank you for sharing your feedback with us; it is very valuable. I will follow up with the Transportation Leadership Team to address the way the drivers communicate with partners about this issue. To provide some context, there are two main reasons why drivers may not take pallets when dropping off food during a delivery. Firstly, they may have food for an immediate order or need to pick up food from another site for the warehouse, which means they cannot have food and pallets on the truck at the same time due to food safety (Pallets are often leftoutside- on the ground, possibly in the rain, and are often dirty) and consideration for our partners. Secondly, our drivers may be on tight schedules and do not have the time for a pallet pickup due to their busy delivery schedules, especially during the busy season. There is no reason why a driver could not explain this to you at the time, and I will ensure that this information is communicated to them. I apologize for your experience. Thank you, ""D"" [10/01/2024 10:21] I spoke with the Transportation Supervisor, and she mentioned that she received feedback about the pallets not being stacked properly and having trash around them. She has scheduled a pallet pickup for tomorrow. Please make sure that the pallets are stacked together to allow the equipment to pick them up easily, there is no debris around them, and they are placed on concrete, not on grass. Thank you! [10/01/2024 10:43] !image3.jpeg|thumbnail! This is how the pallets were placed. We canâ€™t stack them any higher, so we have to put them to the side due to our limited space. The driver was rude, which is unusual, as weâ€™ve always had great relationships with all the other drivers. Thanks for picking the pallets soon.

PART1-8122,Charging for Mixed TEFAP Orders,"MAIN CONTENT:
MAIN CONTENT: MAIN CONTENT: Hi team, I hope you are doing well! I recently learned that partners are being charged for orders that are mixed TEFAP and non-TEFAP. I double checked with the states, and no cost can be associated with TEFAP, even if there are other items included. Can you please remove the associated charge, and let me know if you have questions or concerns before moving forward. Austin, just including you as an FYI. Thanks! Alexis",,Agency Administration,General Questions,Portal,Closed,Medium,2024-12-24 02:26:00,2025-01-24 12:34:00,02:35:00,15:31:00,"[01/03/2025 01:20] Good morning, Alexis, I hope this message finds you well, and Happy New Year! Thank you for providing this important information; it is definitely something we need to note. To give you some background, partners have been charged delivery fees for orders that include a mix of TEFAP products and other donated or purchased items for some time. As stated in our SMART Shopping Policy, orders that contain only TEFAP products do not incur a delivery fee. However, orders that mix TEFAP with purchased or donated products do have a delivery fee associated with them. I do not have the ability to remove delivery fees from all orders, as these fees are automatically added when partners place their orders. I believe we will need to submit an ERP ticket to stop this charge permanently, as it is an automated process. To clarify what the ticket would entail: Are we asking for no delivery fees to be applied to any orders containing any TEFAP items for al regions? Additionally, will we need to issue refunds for past orders that were charged delivery fees due to the mix of TEFAP and other products? I anticipate that partners will inquire about previous orders that included these fees as we proceed with this change and it also may be a good idea to plan for a formal communication to TEFAP partners since this is a change in poliy that we have previously stated to them. Is there a deadline for when this needs to be implemented? I understand that it should be done as soon as possible, but any changes/refunds to delivery fees are always approved by Austin, who is currently out until January 9th. Thank you for bringing this matter back to our attention again, hope to resolve this as soon as possible! Best, ""D"" [01/03/2025 05:19] Hey ""D"", happy new year and thanks for your response! Yes, weâ€™re asking for no delivery fees to be applied to any orders containing any TEFAP items for al regions. But, I donâ€™t think we need to issue refunds or change this immediately. I can flag this to Austin for when she returns and circle back to you. Agreed that weâ€™ll need to send out a communication, and my thought is we can word it as this will be our process going forward. [01/24/2025 12:33] Closing this ticket as this issue is currently being handled by Alexis and Austin. If any further steps are taken, the associated teams will be made aware."

[10/24/2024 01:31] Dr. Head, We appreciate the wonderful service you provide to your community and your partnership with CAFB for the last 15 years. Different programs within CAFB have different rules and regulations. TEFAP falls under the rules and regulations of MD DHS, collection of SDI forms is one of the requirements set forth by them not by myself or by CAFB. I completely understand that the work that you and all your volunteers do is hard and exhausting work. We also understand that not everyone is able to, qualifies for, or feels comfortable completing the SDI form. This is why we do always recommend there be non TEFAP food set aside for those do not qualify or are unable to complete the SDI form. My goal is not to suspend New Hope and Life Church of God, it is to work with you and each partner to ensure there is compliance with regulations set forth by MD DHS, to work together when other problems arise, and to get to know each partner to the best of my ability so that I can continue to advocate for change at the state level. Regarding the monthly inventory report for the month of August, like covered in the civil rights training, regardless of whether food was distributed a report must still be submitted. In the case of no distribution, you would just need to put 0 under the household and individuals served, note any inventory you have at the time, sign and submit. I can also look at your sales order record and send you the food ordered around that time frame which may help in the completion of the report. I do want to remind you that I am out of town tomorrow Friday October 24th and Monday, October 28th. Like stated in the previous emails, what needs to be submitted on Wednesday, October 23rd is the signed corrective action plan, a summary of how you will be collecting SDI forms, and submission of the monthly inventory reports that have not yet been submitted. Submission of the reports can be through the links originally sent or if your organization completed the reports previously, they should have been sent an email copy of the report which can then be emailed to me. I appreciate your patience, understanding and the work you and you organization does for the community. Best, Lucy {color:inherit} {color}{color:#172B4D}{color}{color:inherit}{color}"

However, while speaking with Charity during the training and relaying that I would like to separate the locations, she told me in stead of selecting my own credentials through the link, CAFB would create them for me using my email address for all but a different password for each.

If you would like to add a different location, I will need to conduct a site visit to ensure food safety and we will need to have a larger conversation around how the food will be distributed between the two sites. I believe when we spoke on the phone previously, we agreed you would begin ordering again for the Kennedy Shelter to see the types of food we have available.

Thank you for bringing this to our attention! I have discussed this matter with our leadership and the team involved in this initiative. We appreciate you reopening the discussion. When we initiated this plan, our goal was to alleviate the burden on our Tuesday schedule due to the number of large deliveries we have on that day. However, we acknowledge the challenges this has caused for your agency, which was not our intended outcome. Letâ€™s work together to find a solution! One option I wanted to explore with you is whether you would be open to either receiving all your food items on Fridays or accepting deliveries on Mondays instead of Tuesdays. Please let me know your preference, and if neither option works for you, I will take that information back to our department leaders and Operations for further consideration. Our aim is to ensure that we do not burden your distribution or volunteers. Thank you, Pastor Oliver!

Thanks, Toni Gaines Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church{color:#575757}{color} [08/16/2024 01:49] Good afternoon, Â We contacted the TEFAP Team and learned that we anticipate receiving a shipment of catfish between October 16th and 31st. Currently, we do not have a waitlist or a reminder system linked to our inventory to alert partners when items are back in stock. This is feedback we have received from partners and have conveyed to our Food Resourcing and Inventory Teams for consideration. Â If you wish to check back during that time and do not see the catfish available, we would be happy to reach out to the TEFAP team to confirm if the shipment is still expected during that period. It seems that in your original order, the product went out of stock. Our inventory is live and operates on a first-come, first-served basis as you know. At times, items may be taken by the time you start the checkout process, resulting in an error message prompting you to update your item quantities based on what's available. Â Additionally, there may be different lots of items with varying expiration dates. Consequently, you may have two lots of the same product arriving at different times, with one having a later expiration date than the other. Depending on the date of your order, the item may have gone out of stock for the specific case lot you selected, even though there are still some available on the menu. This occurs due to the date you chose for your order. Â We acknowledge that our inventory system is complex and are striving to make it more user-friendly and accessible for partners to obtain information from the website. Â Thank you, Customer Relations"
